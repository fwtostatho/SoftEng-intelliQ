This is the Software Engineering class project for team 22 for 2022-2023.

## Recommended IDE Setup

[VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) + [Volar](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.volar) (and disable Vetur) + [TypeScript Vue Plugin (Volar)](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Vue.vscode-typescript-vue-plugin).


## Project Setup

```sh
npm install
```
Node.js, MongoDB and Postman need to be installed.

For the data dump backup/restore, [MongoDB Command Line Database Tools need to be installed](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/database-tools), the downloaded contents need to be added to the MongoDB installation path, and the bin folder from there needs to be added to the system's PATH variable.

### Compile and Hot-Reload for Development

```sh
npm run dev
```

### Load the frontend

```sh
npm run serve
```

### CLI

```sh
npm install -g
```
This command is recommended to be run while on the CLI folder.
